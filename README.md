# DYBICO-HT_PostProcessing
Post-processing for home training DYBICO data to characterize progress and present it to the researcher. 

## Paradigm time naming conventions
The training paradigm for each individual is divided into training days. Each training day consists of three sessions, separated by a self-paced pause. Within each session, there are 3 blocks of 20 trials of each condition.  

## Performance measurements
The following measures are of interest for characterizing learning progress:
- Time on target
- Error at the final 500 ms of the trial 
- Reaction time (only relevant for at least block-averaged data)
- Hand separation (most relevant for the asymmetric condition)

Other factors that are relevant for performance are:
- Hand (L/R)
- Condition (A/S)
- Force step size (2.5-10% of max force)
- Force direction (I/D)
- (Time between training days)

## Background measures of importance
The following background measures can be of importance for daily performance or to check on device stability. 
- Max force (L/R)
- Time and quality of sleep
- Physical activity
- Time of day of training
